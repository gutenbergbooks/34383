<h2>PRELUDE</h2>


<p class="hang1"><i>Wild, rocky scenery in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem.... Night--The
moon shining dimly through jagged clouds.... In the distance is seen
the fire of the great sacrificial altar, burning on the horizon.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>SCENE I</h2>

<p class="hang1"><i>Dark shadows flit in groups across the background from right to left.</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">Hadidja, I am afraid!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>
<p class="normal">Come!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">I am afraid. Seest thou not those gliding shadows? Their feet scarce
touch the stones, and their flesh is like the shadow of the night-wind.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Fool that thou art! Thou art afraid of thy companions in misery and
suffering. The same need as thine brings them hither; the same hope
leads them on to the heights.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">Do they also wish to go to him?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Every one wishes to go to him. Is there a light in Israel which doth
not irradiate from his hand? Is there water for the thirsty which doth
not flow from him? Streams of sweet water gush forth from these dead
stones, and his voice is born out of silence.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">But I am afraid of him. Why dwelleth he among the terrors of the
desert? Why flieth he from the paths of the joyous, and shunneth the
suffering?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">The joyous need him not. The suffering will find their way to him.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">Look, Hadidja! There is the glow of fire yonder above Jerusalem. The
Romans are burning down our houses, and yet we tarry here!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">What! Dost thou not know that is the great altar on which, day and
night, the priests offer up a tenth part of the sweat of our brows?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>In horrified amazement.</i>] And would he let the great altar fall too?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">I know not. But what he willeth is best. See--who is coming?</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>SCENE II</h3>

<p class="hang1"><i>The same; two men, half carrying, half dragging a paralytic who
moans.</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">FIRST MAN</p>

<p class="normal">Women, say, have ye met the great Rabbi whom men call the Baptist?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">We also are seeking the Baptist.

<p class="normal">[<i>The Paralytic, moaning.</i>] Put me down; let me die!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">FIRST MAN</p>

<p class="normal">We have carried this palsied man here in our arms, and they are weary,
and he whom we hoped to find is not here.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">THE PARALYTIC</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>With a groan.</i>] I shall die!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA'S VOICE</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Crying aloud from the right.</i>] John! John!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Rushing on the scene.</i>] John, where art thou, John? I cry unto thee
in my distress. Have mercy; let me behold thee, John!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Pointing to the left.</i>] Look! A crowd of people are drawing near. They
go before him.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Kneel; for it is he.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>SCENE III</h3>

<p class="hang1"><i>The same. John, behind him a number of men and women, among them
Amarja.</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Whose wretchedness is so great that he wails aloud, and forgets that
grief should be silent?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Kneeling before him.</i>] Rabbi, mighty Rabbi. If thou art he of whom
men are talking in the streets of Jerusalem, help me, save me!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Stand up and speak.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">I am Manassa, the son of Jeruel, and my father was sick and blind; and
I lived with him on the road to Gibeon, close by the well which is
never dry. And men came unto me who said, &quot;It is the will of the Lord
our God that ye refuse to pay tribute to the Romans,&quot; and I refused to
pay the Romans tribute. Then have the soldiers fallen on me and burned
my house, and my young wife hath perished in the flames, and my father,
who was blind. And I am now left alone and desolate. Help me, Rabbi!
Help!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Am I lord over Life and Death that I can make thy father, wife, and
child alive again? Can I build up thy house once more out of its ashes?
What dost thou ask of me?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">Then cursed be those who----</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Stop! Cursings enough hang over us. Israel is loaded with them, like
the autumn boughs with ripe grapes. Wherefore dost thou lament? Look
before, instead of behind. If thou canst not withhold thy lamentations,
put a gag between thy teeth; for prayer should be silent, and longing
and patience without sound.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">How shall that help me, Rabbi, in my loneliness and desolation?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Thou speakest sinfully. Is He not with thee?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi! Who?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMARJA</p>

<p class="normal">Hearken! He hath not heard the news of Him Who cometh!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Know'st thou not that soon there will be rejoicing in Israel? Bridal
garments and music of cymbals! Know'st thou not that there will be no
more sorrow in Israel? Therefore wipe the foam from thy lips and
sanctify thyself.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ALL</p>

<p class="normal">Sanctify thyself!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">No more sorrow. No more suffering! Rabbi, say that I may stay with
thee?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Mix with thy fellows over there and learn silence.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MANASSA</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Stammering.</i>] Rabbi! [<i>He withdraws.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I see not Josaphat among ye. Neither is Matthias here. Who hath tidings
of them?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMARJA</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, none hath seen them.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Who is that lying on the ground groaning?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">THE PARALYTIC</p>

<p class="normal">Master, I am a poor man, sick of a palsy and in great agony. If Thou
canst not cure me, I must die!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Die <i>now</i>! Now, when One is at hand Who bringeth relief for thy tumours
and balm for thy sores? I say unto Thee thou wilt thank the Lord thy
God with shouts of joy for every hour of thy pain, for every inch of
the road thou hast crawled along on inflamed knees, when thou beholdest
Him for Whom our soul longeth and hopeth, for Whose coming we wait and
watch by the roadside, looking towards the East. Therefore endure
sevenfold suffering and groan no more.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">THE PARALYTIC</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, thou hast done wonders for me. I feel no longer--I----[<i>He makes
an effort to rise, but sinks back. His companions lead him away. He
breathes more easily, laughing as he goes.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MURMUR OF PEOPLE</p>

<p class="normal">See! a miracle. He works miracles!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ONE OF THE PEOPLE</p>

<p class="normal">Truly the word is fulfilled--Elias is risen. The Great Prophet is risen
from the dead!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ANOTHER</p>

<p class="normal">No, not Elias, not the Prophet! See ye not, ye blind? It is He Himself!
He is the promised One. Worship Him! worship Him!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ALL</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Falling on their knees.</i>] Worship Him!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">A man sick of a fever crawled along the road looking for the physician,
and when a beggar or a slave came by, carrying water, he fell on his
knees before him and cried, &quot;Hail to thee, great physician! Thank God,
thou art come!&quot; And so he went on till evening, and the children mocked
him. [<i>The people rise slowly.</i>] What have I, the beggar, to give you?
The water I carry is to baptize you in; it is the pure water of
repentance. But He Who cometh after me will baptize with fire and the
Spirit, and I am not worthy to unlatch His shoes, ... so little am I
compared with Him.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">SEVERAL</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, tell us, when will He come of Whom thou speakest?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">OTHERS</p>

<p class="normal">Who is it, Rabbi? Be merciful and strengthen our souls. Speak to us of
Him.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Then sit ye down in a circle and hear the oft-told tidings, ye
insatiable ones. [<i>The people crouch on the ground.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">Hadidja, what is he going to tell us?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Be silent.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">Let me take thy hand, Hadidja.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">It was on the banks of Jordan that I baptized all, according to the
command of the Lord. Many people were gathered round me and hearkened
to what I preached, but my soul was consumed with doubt and misgiving.
Then, lo, a youth came down from the cliffs above, and he was alone,
and all the people drew back. And as I raised my eyes to his face, I
knew that this was He, for the glory of eternity shone round about Him.
And when He spake with me, and prayed me to baptize Him as if He were a
sinner, I trembled and refused, saying, &quot;I would be baptized by Thee,
but <i>Thou</i> comest to me?&quot; And He made answer, &quot;So be it, for thus shall
the law be fulfilled.&quot; Then I yielded, and let it be as He desired. And
when He had received Baptism from my trembling hand, He rose from the
water, and behold, the Heavens opened above Him and I saw the Holy
Ghost descending like a white dove, and He was bathed in the Heavenly
light. And a voice out of Heaven spake, &quot;Behold, this is My Beloved
Son, in Whom I am well pleased.&quot; Then I fell on my face and prayed. And
I was no longer afraid.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ONE OF THE CROWD</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>After a pause.</i>] And whence came He, He Who was thus illumined by the
radiance of the Lord?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ALL</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, whence came He, and whither did He go? Didst thou not hold Him?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Plague me not with questions. He cometh and goeth, and no man holdeth
Him. At this very hour He may be sitting in our midst.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ALL</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Turn on each other a scared and inquiring gaze.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMARJA</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, we are all poor workpeople from Jerusalem, and every one knoweth
his fellow.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ONE OF THE CROWD</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Pointing to Miriam.</i>] Yes, we men! But here is a woman whom I never
saw before.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Her name is Miriam, and she serves as maid in the Palace, as I do.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Leave her in peace.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ANOTHER</p>

<p class="normal">But if He of Whom thou speakest dwells among the living, He must bear a
name, and His Father's name.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ALL</p>

<p class="normal">Yea; tell us His name. His name?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Ye would hear his name? Listen to the wind whispering among the rocks,
mark well what it saith ere it vanisheth. So His name, heard first here
and then there, passed by my ear. I am waiting with prayer and anxiety
to hear it again. Therefore I say unto you, Question me not further,
lest it melt away like a dream when the cock croweth.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMARJA</p>

<p class="normal">Yet give us withal some guidance. Whence came He to thee--He----</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Aye, let us seek Him!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Think ye that He will permit Himself to be found by you? Ye miserable
creatures full of mutiny and revolt! Who are ye that ye should alter
the course of the world's history by a hair's breadth? When the time
for His harvest is ripe, then He shall appear to you of His own free
will in glory as the Lord of Hosts. The four cherubim shall ride before
Him on caparisoned horses, with flaming sickles in their hands....
Whatsoever hath been planted in sin and hath grown up rankly, that
shall be mown down, root and branch; whatsoever hath reared itself
against Him shall be trampled upon. Therefore, ye men of Israel, root
up the weeds that flourish and encumber your bodies, so that ye do not
rot, and in your corruption are not swept away with your polluters when
<i>He</i> draweth near with the seven-coloured rainbow about His head. He
Who shall come must come [<i>reflectively</i>], must come!</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Josaphat, so thou art here. And thou, Matthias.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Master, chide us not for having lingered. We paused by Herod's Palace,
which, as a rule, is dark and deserted. We saw rosy lights kindled, and
the pillars garlanded with flowers. Fresh ignominy shall befall Israel,
more deadly sin weigh upon her, if thou, Rabbi, comest not to the
rescue.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Speak out!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Herod hath not come out of Galilee, as every year before, for the
Passover. He is not expected till to-morrow. Another guest hath
arrived. The wife of Philip, Herod's brother, hath deserted him, and
taken with her Salome, Philip's daughter.</p>

<p class="normal">The guest at the Palace is called Herodias, and to-morrow the marriage
feast is to be celebrated.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Between Herod and the wife of his own brother?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Thou sayest right, Rabbi.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">No! No! Whoever hath told thee this informed thee falsely. His lips
were shameless, and his soul lied.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMARJA</p>

<p class="normal">Pardon, Rabbi; there are maids here belonging to the Palace....
Question them.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Hadidja, I know thee. Speak!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, my place is menial. I only hear what the idle gossips say. But
here is Miriam. She has been chosen as the playmate of the young maiden
Salome since she came yesterday. She waits on her at the bath. Question
her!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Miriam, why art thou silent?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, she hath never yet conversed with strangers.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">Continue!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">And after the wedding, on the first day of the Passover, Herodias is to
enter the Temple, as far as the women's outer court, her new consort
leading her by the hand. They will show themselves to the people.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">That the people may stone them? But what am I saying? They dare not!
Those priests, lustful as they are, cowards cringing in the dust at the
feet of the Romans, dare not permit this! The iron gates will close
upon the scandal, and the High Priest will stretch forth his arm to
curse them!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">Speak, Miriam!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">What else hast thou to say, Miriam?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">Master, at this very hour, messengers are passing to and fro between
Herodias and the Temple. The Princess desireth that the High Priest
shall meet them at the second gate, where the men and women separate,
to bless her----</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Enough! Go home, all of you. I wish to be alone. To-morrow ye will see
me at Jerusalem. [<i>Horror amongst the people.</i>]</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, wilt thou be responsible for thy enemies?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">OTHERS</p>

<p class="normal">Reflect, Rabbi! The Pharisees will trap thee. The priests will condemn
thee.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I am the son of a priest. I will speak priestly words to those who
countenance this infamous crime. I will speak to them in the name of

<p class="hang1"><i>Square in front of the Palace of Herod--The guardroom of the Roman
soldiers is to the right of the Palace in the foreground, with benches
before the door--To the right of centre is the chief entrance--Steps in
background, which lead to the top of a hill--Behind, separated by an
invisible valley, is a view of rising masses of house-tops belonging to
another part of the town--A narrow street to the left of centre, and
another street in foreground, which may be taken as a continuation of
the one that runs to right of guard-room--In it is the shop of the

<p class="normal">Forgive me, neighbour; accuse me not. I sinned out of ignorance.... I

<p class="normal">Who can tell? Since that woman entered there yesterday, my nostrils
have scented bloodshed. Everything is upside down in Herod's house, and

<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">FIRST SOLDIER</p>

<p class="normal">What brings the Tetrarch of Galilee to Jerusalem?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">SECOND SOLDIER</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, well mayest thou ask! Yet he cometh twice or thrice in the year to
rub his nose on the fleeces of the Temple, and then away he goes again.
God requires it of him, so they say. A crazy people!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">FIRST SOLDIER</p>

<p class="normal">And we must stand by as guard of honour. A nice business for a Roman

<p class="normal">If only there were no foreigners! I, for my part, take not kindly to
these Asiatics. They wash all day long, and yet stink in spite of

<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">SECOND SOLDIER</p>

<p class="normal">When will she return?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HADIDJA</p>

<p class="normal">That we cannot say, priests; it depends on the coming of the Prince.</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Drawing near humbly.</i>] Forgive me, neighbour, but now thou no longer

<p class="normal">No.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">PASUR</p>

<p class="normal">This will be a sorry Passover for us tradesmen. See all this fine stock
which I have laid in. There is the sacred pomegranate wood, whereon to
roast the lamb. Here are the sweet herbs, with which to prepare the
holy broth, and here are the bitter roots, the garlic, cresses, and bay
leaves, all according to the precept. In six, or at latest seven hours
the feast begins, and I shall be left stranded with my whole stock on
hand. Oh, woe is me! Woe is me!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ELIAKIM</p>

<p class="normal">Well, have I not also superior and holy wares for sale? There are
stuffs of the very finest quality. Beautiful tassels of white and
hyacinth-blue wool. And are not my Tephillims the most beautiful ever
worn by a son of Abraham at morning prayer? Nay, Abraham himself never
wore a finer Tephillim. I believe I have eighteen dozen or more. But
one should take no thought of bodily raiment, but read the Scriptures.
So it is written.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">PASUR</p>

<p class="normal">But, neighbour, the man who deals in vegetables does not find it so
easy to be righteous in the sight of the Lord. Thy woollen goods will
keep till Herod is gone again with his new wife.</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Shakes his fist at the Palace.</i>] It's a shame, a crying shame!</p>

<p class="normal">Yes; once this was always a good spot for business, but now grass
groweth in front of the Palace.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">CITIZEN</p>

<p class="normal">Thou art a righteous man and knowest the law. Give me advice, and thou
shalt have my thanks. My poor wife has hurt her foot while working in
the fields. It is burning and swollen, and I bathe it with cold water
from the fountain, which does it good. But in a short time beginneth
the feast. May I continue with the bathing then?</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Oh, Lord eternal!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ELIAKIM</p>

remedy into her mouth. But foot! No!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">CITIZEN</p>

<p class="normal">But suppose that it mortifies!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ELIAKIM</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ELIAKIM</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Points to him, looking shocked.</i>] Hush, if thou lovest thy life! The
man thou seest yonder is one David, belonging to the Zealots who dwell
in the desert. They come down to the towns with daggers hidden in the
folds of their cloaks. And when they find people committing a breach of
the law by word or deed, they strike at them from behind. [<i>Rising, as
the stranger approaches.</i>] Greeting; thou holy man! Behold I know thee
well. Wilt thou not bless thy servant? [<i>The stranger passes, and
disappears in the street to the left.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">PASUR</p>

<p class="normal">Of a truth, we Hebrews are hunted like vermin. If the Romans leave us
alone, the law strikes at us.</p>

<h3>SCENE VI</h3>

<p class="hang1"><i>The same. The stage has become half-filled with people, who
gesticulate in excitement, looking up at Herod's Palace. Among them
Hachmoni; later, the soldiers.</i></p>

<p class="normal">What is going on there? Hachmoni, thou shalt speak. What ails the

<p class="normal">The Baptist, man!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ELIAKIM</p>

<p class="normal">The Baptist; enemy of the Priests and of the Pharisees; to whom every
Rechabite hath sworn death. Is he caught at last?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HACHMONI</p>

<p class="normal">Thou speakest like one in his sleep! If there is a man in Jerusalem
safe and untouched by the curse of the Romans, it is he. He standeth in
the market-place and preacheth; he standeth at the gates and
preacheth.--Did I say <i>preach</i>? Firebrands issue from his lips;
scorpions leap out of his mouth.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">ELIAKIM</p>

<p class="normal">Against whom doth he preach, then?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HACHMONI</p>

<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMASAI</p>

<p class="normal">Look at them! Must this not appear a mad mockery in the sight of the
Lord? Who that follows the straight path laid down by the law, after
the manner of God-fearing men, can have anything in common with these
sinners?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JORAB</p>

<p class="normal">They are infatuated with the Baptist's preaching, and yet too weak to
kick against the pricks. Speak to them, so that they come to
themselves.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMASAI</p>

<p class="normal">After the Baptist? Rather would I grasp a mad bull by the horns. They
would go up to the Temple to make an offering of sow's blood, if he
bade them do it.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JORAB</p>

<p class="normal">Cannot we trap him?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMASAI</p>

<p class="normal">And so stand before the people as the friends of Herod? Leave that kind
of fame to the Priests and the Sadducees. The disaffection which we
quelled, at a signal from him, screams aloud in the gutter. So what
good have we done? That is why the people flock to him. We have missed
our opportunity. But still; I know a way to entangle him. I will strike
at him through his folly about the Messiah. [<i>Shouts of applause arise

When the Lord redeemed His people the first time, how did He do it?
Through the law. And when He redeemed them a second time, knowest thou
how He did it? Through the law. So if we guard and watch this law, and
let it expand by itself, swelling like an ear of corn, a thousand times
into a thousandfold blessings, what is our object? Redemption, the hope

Do you know why we have been suddenly mewed up in the apartments above?
Yesterday we were allowed to wander as we listed through all the

railings and mock the passers-by. But to-day, since my uncle came, we

I was with my father in Antioch, I met pale youths with golden brown
hair, and they wore red shoes and smelt of perfumes.... They were
Greeks, my father said, real Greeks from Hellas.... They smiled, and it

blood of the great Herod in your veins. My mother hath it, and I have
it from her.... And whatever they may say in Jerusalem, my mother was
wise to run away from that other husband, for the one here is of more
account than he. And because she was so wise, and at the same time so
sadly foolish, I love her, and will share the consequences of her
folly. [<i>She flings herself on the couch.</i>] I am not displeasing to my

<p class="normal">Thou hast rested; art refreshed?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">That question thou oughtst not to ask me. My father was one of those
men who never knew what weariness was. So his son, likewise, parts
company with his pillow betimes, and---- [<i>He observes Salome who, with
her veil slightly lifted, looks down from the balcony, and after she
sees that he has noticed her, vanishes.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">Thou art silent.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MEROKLES</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, mistress, they are servants whom thou mayest safely make thy
friends.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JABAD</p>

<p class="normal">And they are friends in order that they may serve thee.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">GABALOS</p>

<p class="normal">And are amply rewarded for both, great mistress.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Smiling.</i>] This rascal, whose Syrian dialect thou art now acquainted
with for the first time, is Gabalos from Antioch. Thou seest, I
tolerate his jesting.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">GABALOS</p>

<p class="normal">For Herod the Great also kept a Fool.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">And people say that he acquired a second Fool before he let the first
drown.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">GABALOS</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Bows, smiling, then turns aside with a grimace.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">This is Merokles, the rhetorician. His voice carries far. It is heard
in Rome, when folks there would overhear my own.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MEROKLES</p>

<p class="normal">But I shall take no satisfaction in that voice till it may greet thee,
mistress, with the cry &quot;Hail to thee, O Queen!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Winces, then smiles and exchanges a glance with Herod.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MEROKLES</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Sotto voce, joining Gabalos.</i>] Thou madest a good hit; I a better.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">And in contrast to this cool flatterer, here is Jabad the Levite, my
guide and my conscience ever since I set foot on Jewish soil. For, by
Bacchus, he knows exactly what I have to do, every moment, in order to
be pious, after the manner of my pious people.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">GABALOS</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Sotto voce.</i>] He acts as if he had forgotten the way.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MEROKLES</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Sotto voce.</i>] For by so doing he thinks he will the more resemble his
father.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">As an example, what ought I to be doing at this sacred moment?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JABAD</p>

<p class="normal">The sun is sinking, oh master. Thy Passover lamb, one year old and
flawless, hath been slaughtered in the Temple. It is now in the yard to
be blessed. Thou, as the lord and master of this house----</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Must do it myself?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JABAD</p>

<p class="normal">Thine illustrious father did not, and there was, on that account,
grumbling amongst the people.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Blessing is cleaner work than slaughter. I will do it. See, ye wise
Greeks, that we must serve the gods in order to rule over men! And in
the end we serve to no purpose. [<i>He motions them away. To Jabad.</i>] Go
and make ready, and I will follow thee. [<i>Exeunt Gabalos, Merokles, and
Jabad.</i>]</p>

<p class="normal">Art thou content?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Thy kindness oppresses me. Whether thou art content seemeth to me of
more importance.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Feeling his tone of contempt.</i>] I have had no roof over my head for
three nights. Like a tramp I have wandered in the dust of the roads. My
serving-women one by one deserted me. Only Salome hath not forsaken me.
I have robbed her of her father; the father I have robbed of his child.
And what I have robbed my husband of thou canst estimate better than it
beseemeth me. See, all this I have done for thee!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">I have abandoned my wife, who also said she loved me. She flew to her
father. He now maketh ready for war to avenge his child's wrong. Only a
trifle is lacking: I have no army. In Rome I am threatened with
disgrace; my brother curses me; Judea points the finger of scorn at
me.... So little have I done for thee----</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">And thou repentest this little already?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">No! only forgive me if I blame thy coming too soon.</p>

<p class="normal">Take not my words amiss, I entreat thee!</p>

<p class="normal">I dare not say that longing drove me here.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>With an embarrassed smile.</i>] Say it ... by all means!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

vows--when every breath was a longing desire and every word a feast?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">How should I forget? Love, how should I----?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">And thou rememberest no more the nights when wandering footsteps stole
their way to the fragrant gardens, where, in the feverish blossoming
around them, two sleepless ones mingled their sighs?</p>

<p class="normal">How could I not remember; Love, how could I not?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">I have clothed myself in Indian draperies; I have put pomegranate
blossoms in my bosom, and gold dust in my hair ... but thou seest
nothing!... My converse is bridal, but thou hearest it not.</p>

<p class="normal">Thinkest thou that I have been idle? Am I a woman who cometh to beg of
you a nightly dole of caresses? Look at me.... Not thy beloved.... She

say I raved, thou wast reflecting how thou couldst best get rid of
me.... Thou fool; then get rid of thy wakeful nights and all that which
thou thinkest great in thyself, the inheritance of that greater than
thou, whom thou wilt never equal....</p>

Never resemble.... What is the man who smiles amiably in wrath? A
coward?... What is the man, who has two faces? Insincere?... Who fawns
on those in power. Servile? No; because the great Herod also did these
things. But sometimes, when the blood throbbed to bursting in his
veins, he snatched his sword from the sheath and slashed at friend and
enemy alike who stood in his way ... till the blood of his victim
washed him calm and cool again ... till the mighty at Rome experienced
a thrill at such a display of strength.... I, too, feel the blood
hammering in my veins.... I, too, would ... but I have no sword ... and
so I must continue to smile amiably ... continue showing two faces, and
licking the sandals of the priests.... I, the son of Herod; I, his ape!</p>

<p class="normal">Thou?</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HERODIAS</p>

<p class="normal">What if instead of hiding the sinning woman from the people, thou, with
head held aloft, repairest with her to the Temple? Would it not be an
ironical event if the High Priest, with the same air of patriarchal
servility with which he greeted the virtuous Mariamne, also smiled a
welcome to thy brother's runaway wife?</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JAEL</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Lifting the children from their knees.</i>] Just now we ate of the lamb

<p class="normal">I do not speak of to-day; to-day the poorest have something to eat.
Thou art truly a great prophet, Rabbi, and thou givest much to the
people; but from us--from me and these little children--thou takest
away all that we have.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JAEL</p>

<p class="normal">See; for a long time my husband goeth out every night to thee in the
wilderness, and then the tools lie there idle, and we starve. But
willingly would we starve and die of hunger for him, if thou hadst not
estranged his heart from us, and stolen his love for thyself.</p>

<p class="normal">Josaphat, how long have I known thee?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">It is two years since I came to thy baptism.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">And since, thou hast been often?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Have I not always been with thee, Rabbi?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I never knew that thou wast a cobbler ... and that thy children cried
for bread! It seems to me that I do not know thee even yet, Josaphat.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Thou knowest what is best in me, for thou hast given it to me!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">So, then, I know myself alone. And of thee, too, Amarja, I know no
more.... Only this I know. [<i>Gazing into vacancy.</i>] I am sent----
[<i>Breaks off.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Some one hath said to me that I knew ye not; one of those who have the
word &quot;love&quot; on their tongues.... And I am inclined to believe her....
But even if I have known you, I have not desired to love you, but
rather to judge you in the name of---- In whose name? Know ye the rest?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">In the name of Him Who shall come. So thou hast taught us, master.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Sooner would I talk to these black walls, that they might perhaps fall;
sooner to thy hungry children, that my words might fill them. But the
belief that looketh up to me, transfigured because it believeth....
That hurts me.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMARJA</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Low to Josaphat.</i>] It is now the second hour. Wilt thou not mention
Herod to him?</p>

<p class="normal">May be he has lost the way.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">I told him where to come to, master.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I want the Galilean.... Ye shall procure me the Galilean.... See ye not
that my strength rests in my King ... Even if I serve Him like an
unworthy vessel ... I serve Him according to my measure.... I have
borne witness to Him.... Is that not true?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Thou hast borne witness, indeed, Rabbi.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">But the testimony hath grown up in my soul. When He comes, will He bear
it out?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">He will, master; for God sendeth Him.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Else my soul hath not known Him, even as it hath not known you. Have ye
no news of Manassa? Go and keep watch outside, that he doth not miss
the house.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MATTHIAS</p>

<p class="normal">No. Rabbi, I come to thee in the night because of Herod.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Because of Herod? [<i>Seats himself with head turned away.</i>]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MATTHIAS</p>

<p class="normal">I sent spies to the Palace up till the time of the Passover Feast. The
priests were coming to and fro. What their business was no one knows.
And if he cometh now to the morning sacrifice at eight of the clock, as
is his custom on high festivals ... and comes with that woman ...
flaunting his sin in the face of the people.... Rabbi, speak! What
then?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Does not answer,</i>]</p>

<p class="normal">He hears thee not.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT.</p>

<p class="normal">He is thinking of the Galilean.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I heard some one here speak of sin. Know ye in what raiment sin clothes
itself gorgeously when it goeth abroad among the people? Say
courtliness, say hate, say what ye will, and I shall laugh at you.
Hear, and mark well. They call it love. Everything that is small, and
stoops because it is small, that throws crumbs from its table in order
not to throw bread; that covers up graves that they may stink secretly;
that hews off the thumb of the left hand that it may have nothing to
say to the thumb of the right; take care; all that is called love. And
they call it love when in spring the ass brays and the dogs whine; when
a woman herself gathers together the stones whereon to rest with her
lover in the evening, stones which in the morning the people will hurl
at her, and the woman speaketh: &quot;See beloved, how sweet is our couch.&quot;
... They call this love.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MATTHIAS</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>After exchanging a look with Josaphat.</i>] Rabbi, forgive us, but the
people are waiting for thee. The many who desert their beds, expectant
of the morrow, think only of one thing--judgment! The judgment of
Herod.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Judgment of Herod--well.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">And thou shalt judge him. No one else but thou?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I shall judge him.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MATTHIAS.</p>

<p class="normal">Him and the woman?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Him and the woman. Did ye doubt?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MATTHIAS</p>

<p class="normal">If we did, forgive.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">AMARJA</p>

<p class="normal">But suppose he comes without the woman. What would happen then?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Ye ask so much. Ye and your questions become wearisome. Hark! There is
Manassa. [<i>Josaphat opens.</i>]</p>

<p class="normal">I will listen, Miriam.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">A rumour has reached the Tetrarch that the people are plotting evil
against him. He would on that account hide the woman, but she will not
be hid. She will defy the master, because he hath offended her. An
order is just gone forth for all the servants of the house to arm
themselves and line the road. Even during the night, so that the
procession shall pass to the Temple ere the great crowd assembleth.
Thus they think to escape the people's wrath and thine, master.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">THE DISCIPLES</p>

<p class="normal">That shall not come to pass; verily it shall not.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Hast thou learned, Miriam, by which of the outer gates they go to the
Temple?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">By the Susan Gate. I heard the servants say, as I crept by.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">And will the Roman soldiers be amongst them?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MIRIAM</p>

<p class="normal">That I did not hear.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">For if the Romans accompany them, we must wait behind the second gate;
there where no heathen may penetrate at the cost of his head.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MATTHIAS</p>

<p class="normal">On the other hand, they can there be saved by the priests.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Certainly, there the priests---- Master, what is thy counsel?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I counsel you to go forth into the streets, and to seek right and left.
I would learn from that Galilean what counsel I ought to give you.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Ye children of men ... there is a rushing as of many waters in your

at the Temple.</p>

thou never heard of Hannah, the prophetess?</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">I have heard speak of her, when I was a child.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MESULEMETH</p>

<p class="normal">Well, this is her place. Here she sat and waited for the Messiah, forty
years long. When she died she left the place to me ... And now I sit
and wait till He comes again.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Comes again? Hath He then been already?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MESULEMETH</p>

<p class="normal">Certainly He hath.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>In deep emotion.</i>] He came? Came even to thee?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MESULEMETH</p>

But Hannah ... She saw Him when He came.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Woman! I implore thee ... Speak, tell me, how did He come?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MESULEMETH</p>

<p class="normal">Then sit down here beside me, so that I may speak low.... Once a little
lad was brought to the Temple by his mother, to be circumcised. And
there was one called Simeon who, when he saw this boy-babe, was filled
with the Holy Ghost, and said, &quot;Lord, now lettest thou Thy servant
depart in peace, for his eyes have seen Thy salvation, which Thou hast
prepared for all nations.&quot; ... And Hannah heard this, and she came up
to them and recognised Him?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">How did she recognise Him?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MESULEMETH</p>

<p class="normal">Did I not tell thee that she was a prophetess? Otherwise she might not
have recognised Him. But as it was, she praised the Lord, and laid
herself down and died. So now I sit where she sat, and wait for Him to
come again.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Verily, He must come again; and dost thou know, woman, how He will
come? As the Lord of Hosts, arrayed in golden armour, with His sword
drawn above His head, so He will come to save His people Israel. He
will trample His enemies under His horse's hoofs, but the youth of
Israel shall greet Him with hosannas and jubilation. See, woman, that
is how He will come!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MESULEMETH</p>

the prophet of anyone?</p>

<br>

<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">MESULEMETH</p>

<p class="normal">Not that one. I will not have that one. For many have come in golden
armour, and have drawn their sword, and then Israel hath bled after,
like a sacrificial ox. <i>He</i> shall be no king! No! When kings come, they
come to kings! No one hath come, as yet to us, the poor---- Go away,

<p class="normal">Thou hast seen Him?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">FIRST GALILEAN</p>

<p class="normal">Many a time ... from my ship. For He carries on His work on the shore.
And there is always a great gathering along the banks, is there not,
Abia?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">SECOND GALILEAN</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, the banks are always quite black with people. And the fish take
notice of it. That is not good for our trade.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">FIRST GALILEAN</p>

<p class="normal">They say that He works miracles. I once met a man myself who had
been blind till his--I forget what year--and he maintained that
he was made to see again by spittle from His mouth ... It may be
possible--but----[<i>Laughs stupidly.</i>]</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

hath happened, save the weak. But speak on, man.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">FIRST GALILEAN</p>

<p class="normal">It may be all very well for Him to heal the sick, but the worst of it
is He doeth it on the Sabbath. That is bad, bad! And then, His friends
are not well chosen. Circumspect people, naturally, are not disposed to
mix with Him. For how can one trust a man who sitteth at meat with
publicans and sinners? And, then, He is always at weddings and feasts.
Ah! No, no.</p>

that I have never heard thy voice?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">SALOME</p>

<p class="normal">Thou shouldst ask my mother, Sire.</p>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Fiercely.</i>] Thy mother! Still, I know that thou art well disposed

treason at night outside the Palace.</p>

<p class="normal">Could I do less, Sire? And him to whom she betrayed thy secrets, wilt
thou not punish him too?</p>

<p class="normal">I do not know. But how?</p>

they will carry praises of thee to Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="normal">I would rather think that thou wert unlike. My sweet, unveil thyself.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">SALOME</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, if thou wert my father! But thou art not. Directly thou comest
near, my mother herself draweth my veil down deep over my breast.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Unveil to me.</p>
<br>

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">SALOME</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps. Ask my mother.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">A little now. Just a finger's length.</p>

<p class="normal">No, really ... it is not seemly, Sire.</p>
<br>

<h3>SCENE V</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Herod, John. The Gaoler. A Guard.</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me, how should one address thee when one would show thee respect?
Thou thinkest that I mock thee? But knowest thou that in reality I am
indebted to thee? The people's meditated attack was not hidden from me,
and yet I came without the escort of warriors which Rome sent for my
protection. Thou heldest me in the hollow of thy hand, as thou heldest
the stone. Say, why didst thou let it fall? Why hast thou spared me?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, even if I spoke thou wouldst not understand me.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">That is defiance, which I cannot praise. In chains it is easy to be
defiant. Take off his chains and go. [<i>The Gaoler obeys. Exit with the
guard.</i>] Now, as a free man, revile me. Art thou a preacher of
repentance? If so, preach to me!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, thou wouldst not understand me.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">So thou saidst before. Think of something new. Here in Galilee I am
inclined to be mild and tolerant of goodness. I am told that thou
hatest the Pharisees. I hate them too. I am told that thou hatest the
priests. I love them not. I am told that thou hatest the Romans.
I---- Say, why didst thou spare me?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, my heart failed me.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Failed thee! Before me, whom thou callest &quot;the little&quot;! Art thou
flattering me because I have loosened thee from thy chains?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Thou hast not laid me in chains, and canst not loosen me from them.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">What ... and yet I made thee falter?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">It was Another who threw thee in my way.... And so my heart failed me.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Tell me, Baptist--I call thee by the name I have heard people speak of
thee by, and I hope thou wilt not be angry--tell me, Who is that King
of the Jews whose image thou danglest before the people?... See, the
guards are gone, and thy confidence shall be rewarded. Tell me, who is
it?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, I know not.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">And so thou deniest thy own creature?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">What is my own I deny.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Ha, ha, ha! I have half a mind to summon my little Greek that he may go
to school under thee. Listen [<i>in a low voice</i>], I too have heard of a
King of the Jews who will come with a sword drawn above his head, and
he will spare no one who doth not serve him at the right moment.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Eagerly.</i>] Who is it, of whom thou speakest?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Master, I do not know. Thou seest thus that I too have a burden of
secret anxiety oppressing me, and await the sunrise.... But let me
speak with thee seriously, Baptist. Thou hurlest thy arrows of reproach
at me on account of the woman I stole.... I could almost pity thee for
that. Thou, a great man, mightst have chosen a greater subject than a
woman. And knowest thou every day she sharpens those arrows herself for
me?... But enough of that. The smiths say that good metal rings true
even when it is cracked, and thou ringest true. How dost thou manage
it?... I pray thee teach me the way.... What, silent again?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Methinks I know you now, ye smiling scoffers. Ye grow fat on the wit of
the market-places; but hunger seizes you, and ye then lift your eyes to
the earnest ones, walking on the mountain-tops.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">By Bacchus, there lurks some truth in that. But it's not good walking
on the mountain-tops. We wait to see you fall; then we shall not smile,
but laugh.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">But I say unto thee, Sire, thou wilt not laugh. He Who cometh requireth
me not. That is why He cast me down.... Gaze into His eyes when He
comes, and thou wilt not laugh, even at me.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">It seems to me thy reasoning is poor, and revolves in a circle.... And
yet there is something that attracts me to thee. Baptist, thou hast so
long been my enemy, couldst thou not possibly be my friend?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, meseemeth that to be nobody's enemy and nobody's friend is the
right of the lonely. It is their all. Let me keep it.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Yet I do not give thee up as lost. If thou wert so minded we might
pursue the same paths for a spell.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Whither, Sire?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Whither? Upwards!</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">For thee there is no upwards. Thou bearest the times that are and
were before thee, like an ulcerous evil, on thy body. Burnest thou
not from all their poisonous lusts? Art thou not weighted by their
unholy desires? And thou wouldst mount to the heights. Stay in the
market-place and smile.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">Baptist, take care. Thy chains lie not far off.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Let me be chained, Sire; I ask for nothing better.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Gnashing his teeth.</i>] Truly thou art ruled by a broken spirit.
[<i>After a little reflection.</i>] Yet tell me, Baptist, when that other
cometh, that other----Say, was it in His Name that thou didst not throw
the stone at me?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">[<i>Confused.</i>] Sire, what dost thou ask?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

except me. Seest thou now how pious I am? Seest thou? My soul feels thy
strength, and feels it with joy; for I have never seen anyone so strong
as thou art. I have made thankofferings and secret vows like those the
Psalms sing of. Then I have been forth in the gloaming to seek thy
countenance and the light of thy eyes. And I have decked my bed with
beautiful, many-coloured rugs from Egypt, and I have sprinkled my
pillows with myrtle, aloes, and cinnamon. I will give thee my fair
young body, thou barbarian among the sons of Israel! Come, let us make
love till morning. And my playmates shall keep watch on the threshold,
and greet the dawn with their harps.</p>

<p class="normal">And thou hast come this long way to tell me that?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Rabbi, thou shouldst be the way that all the erring follow. Thou
shouldst strengthen weak knees and mould trembling hands to the sword's
hilt. Thy work was wrath, Rabbi, but thou hast made of it a sophistry
and a weakness.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Thou art not to know what my work was. Had I known myself, I should not
be here. Truly the time of my fall is come, when enemies sing my
praises and friends speak ill of me. What would ye have me do? My end
must be in solitude and silence.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOSAPHAT</p>

<p class="normal">Thy end, Rabbi, is no concern of ours. It is for Israel's end that I
fear. Thou tookest the law from us. What hast thou given us instead?</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">JOHN</p>

<p class="normal">Who art thou, that like a kennelled hound, thou bitest at my shanks?
<i>I</i> took the law from you? My soul hath wrestled with the law till it
is weary; my forehead beat against its walls till it bled! But now ye
have opened your mouths wide that salvation should slip down them like
sweet crumbs. Ye gazed up at me so long as I stood erect, and now
shrink away like cowards from my fall. I have not fallen for myself, I
fell for you. To you it was a compulsion and a matter of watching. To
me it was voluntary, and a combat at the sword's point.... Look at me!
Twice to-day I have been face to face with the world's sin. But it
seemed to me almost fair, for I have yet to meet the worst. Thou art a
renegade! Thou hast ever been a renegade, and renegades will ye be to
all eternity, ye men of universal utility, who manure your acres with
the blood of those who have died for you! Go! I am weary of you!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Sire, thou needest have no anxiety about food and drink. Something
customary is best for jaded palates. Therefore I chartered the cook of

<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">GABALOS</p>

<p class="normal">Noble Merokles will declaim a new ode, I warrant. Our Libyan
flute-players will have washed their brown legs in honour of the
occasion. Sire, mistrust those legs even when washed. As I tell thee
every day, we are sick of Judean morality. Judean morality is devouring
us like the plague.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent:0; font-weight:bold">HEROD</p>

how should I ever have conceived the idea had it not been for thy

not have faded from his tired memory when he enters Cæsar's presence.</p>

<p class="normal">Look at me! Here is a woman that no longer adorns her own body because
thou now scornest it; she therefore adorns instead the body that came
from hers. Here is a woman whose breasts have withered because her eyes
have shed tears of blood. Therefore she will let the budding bosom,
from which the veil has never yet fallen, be exposed to thine and thy
guests' lustful gaze. And for this sacrifice of unspeakable bitterness
I ask nothing, for I am without wishes. One who can still hope shall
ask. Salome shall ask.</p>

man can take nothing to himself that is not given him by Heaven. And
unto me nothing was given. The key of death ... I held it not ... the

the name of sin sound, save out of the mouth of the one that loveth.
